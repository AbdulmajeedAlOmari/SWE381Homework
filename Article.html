                <h4>What is a Website Builder?</h4>
                <p>
                    Whether you&#39;re just starting a business or want to move your existing brick and mortar business online, you’ll need to locate a website builder to get you and your brand online.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Website builders come with a variety of options, so it is important to find one that fits you and your website.

                <h4>So what is a website builder exactly?</h4>
                <p>
                    A website builder is software that allows you to create a website online. The software will reside on a web server at a hosting company or be part of a hosted SaaS (software as a service) platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Or in other words, you do not use your local computer (desktop or laptop) to hold software that will build the website. Instead you’ll build the website online via software designed specifically for website creation.
                </p>

                <p>
